Analyses of mRNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq

Welcome to the repository for our course project! This is a collaborative space for developing and refining code related to our chosen topic.

Purpose:
- to learn, develop, and share scripts in Bash and R for sequencing data processing;
- to collaborate on analysis workflows while keeping unpublished data private;
- to ensure that no sensitive or unpublished details are shared in comments, commits, or documentation.

Guidelines:
- No unpublished data. Please do not commit, upload, or reference unpublished data in any form.
- Code Only. Keep discussions focused on code and analysis methods.
- Commit Messages & Comments. Avoid including dataset details or confidential information.
- Collaboration. Feel free to ask for help if youâ€™re stuck, and contribute improvements, suggestions, and discussions via pull requests and issues.

Please follow the guidelines to maintain a clean and secure workspace.

The journey has begun!
